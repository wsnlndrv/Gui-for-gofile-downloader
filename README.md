We have a simple interface to download from gofile.io

It is not a very useful tool since downloads can be done simply from the browser, but sometimes the browser can crash along with the downloads in progress.

So I wanted to share it for whoever wants to use it.

This is working on Gnu/Linux, I don't know if it can be adapted for Windows but probably yes, I don't have Windows to test, sorry.

A good future modification could be to add the sequential download capacity, to leave the program downloading several games while we are not using the PC.
